* The Satellite Image Classification system leverages the power of deep learning to automatically categorize high-resolution satellite imagery into meaningful land cover types such as urban, forest, water bodies, and agricultural areas. This AI-driven solution is designed to assist government agencies, environmental organizations, and urban planners in monitoring land use changes, detecting deforestation, tracking urban sprawl, and optimizing agricultural practices. By automating the classification process, the model significantly reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and enables real-time decision-making. The deployment of this system via a user-friendly Streamlit interface ensures accessibility for non-technical users, making it an ideal tool for scalable geospatial intelligence across sectors like climate monitoring, disaster response, infrastructure development, and smart city planning.
